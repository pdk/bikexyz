### How do we change the game?

Right now, bicycle theft is an epidemic problem. The fundamental problem is that
the reward/risk ratio is too good for thieves, and no good for bicycle owners.

Reporting stolen bicycles and bicycle registration are fundamentally the right idea, but
are currently ineffective. (If you want to argue that they actually are effective, then
you'll have to convince me that there is not a bicycle theft problem. Given the size
of the problem, it's clear that nothing we're doing, currently, is truly effective.)

There are lots of bicycle registries, and there are many channels to share information about
stolen bicycles. Again, the right idea, but still failing. Why do all the attempts fail?

Here is the fundamental problem: 

**Buyers are not checking the status of the bicycles they purchase.**

As a thought experiment, let's imagine the ideal world, Biketopia:

> In Biketopia, 
> whenever a person is considering buying a used bicycle they confirm
> that the person selling the bike has the right to sell it, and that the 
> bicycle is not stolen.  A thief decides that it's easy to steal bicycles, 
> and that he'll be a bicycle thief.  He steals a bike and attempts to sell it.
> He learns that every potential buyer finds out quickly and easily that the bike is stolen, and calls the police.
> The thief has to run away every time. Very soon he learns that it is not
> worth the effort to try and sell a stolen bicycle, because nobody will buy
> it and they keep calling the police. He realizes that stealing bicycles
> is pointless, because he cannot sell them. He gives up on bicycle theft, and
> switches to stealing cars. (Yay!)

Clearly, Biketopia perfection is an unreachable ideal, but it makes the point. The more trouble it
is for bicycle thieves to sell bicycles, the less worthwhile it is, and as a result,
bicycle theft goes down. The closer we get to Biketopia, the lower the rate of bicycle theft.

#### How can we get closer to Biketopia?

Here's how:

1. Make it easy for bicycle owners to report stolen bicycles.
2. Make it trivial for anybody to check if a bicycle has been reported as stolen.
3. Educate every bicycle buyer to always check if a bicycle is stolen when buying a bicycle.

None of these steps is easy, and **all three** must be achieved in order 
for the system to be effective. If any of the three links in this chain is weak,
the whole chain is weak.

The good news is that it is possible to make huge steps forward from where 
we stand now.


#### 1. Make it easy for bicycle owners to report stolen bicycles.

This is the easiest link in the chain. Currently we have lots of registration services, and
lots of ways to report stolen bikes. But we're failing on #2 and #3, so the registries and
reports are nearly worthless. Sometimes there are successes, but the vast majority of lost
bikes are never recovered and thefts continue unabated. The reward/risk ratio is still too
high.

This link can be improved, but currently it is the strongest.


#### 2. Make it trivial for anybody to check if a bicycle has been reported as stolen.

This link is weak. It is possible to search reports of stolen bicycles. It is possible to check 
bicycle registries. The problem is that it's too difficult. Even when buyers, know, theoretically, that
there are high rates of bicycle theft, and that they might be buying a stolen bicycle, they don't 
know how to check. And certainly, they do not know how to check every source of data that
could be relevant.

Bicycle thieves move masses of bikes from city to city, or region to region, in order to reduce the chances of 
being found out. That is to say, they remove bikes from where they might be reported
as stolen to places where there is no report.

Too many bicycle registries are isolated, geographically. There are too many registries and forums to search.

We live in a world where google, facebook, and the internet itself, exist. These things demonstrate
that large networks of information can be built and made easy to use.

Given that all the registries in the world exist to try and solve the problem of bicycle
theft, it should be the case that they all would want to work together to make it
easier for buyers to check the status of a bicycle. 
This is mostly just an engineering/technical problem.

It is possible to make it trivial for anybody to check if a bicycle has been reported as stolen. 
This will require work, and it require many parties working together, but it is totally
solvable.


#### 3. Educate bicycle buyers to check if a bicycle is stolen when buying a bicycle.

Once link #2 is strengthened, it will still be necessary to create a social environment where 
bicycle purchasers know that they must check the status of a bicycle they want to purchase. 
As long as link #2 is weak, social pressure will be ineffective. No amount of peer pressure will
get a person to swim across the Atlantic to visit Grandma, but peer pressure can get a person to 
call her on the phone.

Making something easy to do, makes a huge difference in how many people actually do it.

But, once link #1 and link #2 are strong, then #3 can be addressed.
In some ways, this may be the simplest to address, but will require the most effort. Simply put, this
requires a large public relations campaign. Thru every possible channel, the message "check before you buy" 
has to be communicated. And it has to be demonstrated that you **can** check.
The campaign has to be broad. To make a dent in bicycle thefts in San Francisco, every buyer within 1000 miles
has to know to, and be able to, check if a bike is stolen.

The good news is that these channels exist, and are easy to find. And there are many, many people
waiting to help move this mountain. There are many cycling-specific magazines,
businesses, forums, blogs, etc. All these channels have incentive to aid in combating bicycle theft.

It might be argued that there are too many first-time buyers out there, people who are just beginning 
their cycling adventure, and that they are the ones that need to be reached, and that they
are not part of the current network of bicycle-centric channels. The answer to this is that just about every 
newcomer to cycling will be talking to existing members of the cycling community, asking questions
about how to buy a bicycle, where to buy, etc., and if the message has permeated the cycling community,
it will reach these first-time buyers as well. Even the most casual cyclist visits a bike shop occasionally.

So, we don't have to convince the entire public, we need to only reach the existing cycling 
community, and as people join our community, they will get the message as well.


#### To sum up

It is insufficient to build yet another registry, or yet another service to report stolen bikes. We keep focusing 
on only the first link of this chain, and then giving too little attention to the others. The first link is absolutely
necessary, and required, but it is insufficient to actually solve the problem.

I believe we can make a dent in the bicycle theft epidemic. I believe we have all the tools we need. I actually even
believe that this is inevitable. The choice is: when?  Do we start work on it now, or wait for things to get 
worse? What will the situation be like when there are 10x as many bicycles in use as now?  At some point, enough
people will get sick and tired of this problem, and this solution will happen.

Personally, I'd like to see it happen sooner, and see us get to 10x as many bicycles in use earlier. :)
