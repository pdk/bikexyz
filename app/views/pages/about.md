## About

I (<a href="http://twitter.com/phlatphrog" target="_blank">Patrick Kelly</a>) am very concerned about anthropogenic climate change.

I believe that we need to re-architect our lives so as to reduce carbon emissions. One of
the best life changes a person can make, both for their own health, and for the health of
our Earth, is to cycle more.

One reason that people cycle less than they could is fear of, and frustration with, bicycle theft. Second to locking your bike well, the best tool to combat bicycle theft is bicycle registration.

The problem is that current bicycle registration services are [too hard to use](/why).
The fact that we have epidemic levels of bicycle theft demonstrates that existing
registries are ineffective. Bicycle thieves know too well that buyers will not figure
out that a bicycle is stolen.

I've created bikexyz.com to solve this problem.
