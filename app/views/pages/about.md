## About bikexyz.com

This site is yet another hare-brained creation of Patrick Kelly, aka [phlatphrog](http://twitter.com/phlatphrog).

I (Patrick) am very concerned about climate change, aka global warming, aka the
greenhouse effect.

Fundamentally, I believe that we need to re-architect our lives so as to reduce
carbon emissions. In my view, one of the best changes a person can make,
personally, both for their own health, and for the health of our Earth, is to
ride a bicycle more, and drive a car less.

As I became more familiar with obstacles to increasing cycling, I realized that
one of the primary tools to combat bicycle theft was stuck in pre-internet
thinking. That is to say, I realized that bicycle registration services were
obscure, hard to use and non-obvious.

Currently, if I purchase a used bicycle from someone, I basically have no idea how to verify
their ownership of that bicycle. Even if I know how to find the serial number, how do I know
which of the many, many registration services to check? **How** do I check? Call the police
department? Can I do this right now while the seller waits? What if the local police have no
theft report? Does that mean anything?

This difficulty is what opens to door to epidemic levels of bicycle theft.
Bicycle thieves know that there's no way a potential buyer is going to figure out
that the bicycle is stolen.

I realized that there is a very simple solution to this problem:

**Give every bicycle it's own web address.**

What we get from this is:

* The unique web address goes on the bike
* The owner can easily and directly update the page
* Any person looking at the bike can easily check the status of the bike 

**This** is [disintermediation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disintermediation).
This is what the internet is all about. Removing the middlemen (middlepeople?).

I've created bikexyz.com to provide this service.


### About Patrick
 
Patrick began his internet career in 1993.
He, along with partners Paul and John, founded Kuentos Communications to bring 
the internet to Guam. When potential customers were told
"We sell internet access!" the response was "What's 'internet'?"
Kuentos was acquired by [MCV](http://www.mcvguam.com).

Later Patrick helped build GetActive.com, an on-line advocacy and fundraising platform 
for "more than 800 clients, including The Humane Society of the United States, AFL-CIO, University of California, CARE, Oxfam America, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of REALTORSÂ®."
GetActive was acquired by Convio.

Patrick now works at [Cleantech Group](http://www.cleantech.com), in San
Francisco. (Cleantech Group has not yet been acquired.)
