# bikexyz.com

Aloha and welcome!

Bikexyz.com is a bicycle registration service. Here are some of the main differences between this service and others:

1. It's free.
2. It's internet-centric, not bureaucratic.
2. Your bike gets its own web page.
3. You can update your bike's page whenever you want.
4. Photos! (coming soon...)
4. If/when your bicycle is stolen or lost, you can directly update the page to say so.
5. Any person with basic internet skills can visit the bike's page to see who owns it, and if it's stolen/lost.

What's the catch?

The only catch is that you have to be able & willing to put the web page address on the frame
of your bicycle, so that it's visible and legible to a casual observer.

The more obvious and permanent you make the URL on your bike, the better your chances of
recovery. The options are infinite, and there are trade-offs. Ultimately, it's up to you as to
how you want to put the URL on your bike, but if you're not willing to mark your bike, there's
not much point in registering here.
