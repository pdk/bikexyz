      The Cyclist's Pledge to Fight Bicycle Theft
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>In order to do my part to fight bicycle theft, I pledge that:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      I will register my bicycle(s) 
      <ul>
        <li>online where the registration is publicly viewable, <strong>and</strong></li>
        <li>in all official registries as mandated by local law/regulations (if applicable).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If my bicycle is stolen (or lost), I will <strong>at least</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>file a local police report, <strong>and</strong></li>
        <li>report the theft via my online registry.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Before purchasing a used bicycle, I will,
      <ul>
        <li>search online registries, using the serial number, for reports of it being stolen, <strong>and</strong></li>
        <li>attempt to verify that the seller is the rightful owner via online registration or other documentation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If I discover that a bicycle I have purchased was stolen, I will take all
      possible steps to return it to its rightful owner.
    </li>
  </ol>

#### Notes

In some locales, where bicycle registration is mandated, the police will not accept
a report of a bicycle being stolen if it was not properly registered.

If your bicycle is stolen, you must report it to the police, so that when it is 
located they will actually assist in its recovery. You must report it online so that
potential buyers can discover that it is stolen. Making these two reports
is the absolute minimum action. The more places you report the theft, the
higher your chance of recovery.

When dealing with an online seller of a bicycle, if they have not posted the 
serial number in their ad, request it. If they will not tell you the serial 
number, do not deal with that seller.

Verify that the serial number on the bicycle matches what the seller told you.
If it's off by a single digit, do not buy the bicycle.
