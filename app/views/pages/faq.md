## Frequently Asked Questions

(Nobody has actually asked any of these, but we won't let that stop us!)


#### What is a "URL"?

A [URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator) is a web address.
It is a globally unique name of a page on the world wide web.
Everybody uses them all the time, even when they don't know what
they're called, or how they work. That's actually a good thing.

The real advantage for us is that just about everybody recognizes URLs
and knows how to use them.  If you see

    www.googlygop.com/blahblah
    
Nobody has to explain to you what to do with it. You put it in your computer or phone and see
what comes up.

#### Can't I just create my own page on the internet for my bike?

Yup.

You don't really need bikexyz.com to do any of this. You could just write a blog entry (for example), and put that URL on your bike. Here's a check list:

* A URL (a unique page) for your bike
* You are the only one able to edit it
* You **can** edit it
* The web address fits on your bike, legibly

What's wrong with this approach? If/when you want to sell your bike, you really need to be
able to let the new owner have control of the page. Otherwise they'll have to remove the
stuff you put on the bike, and start over from scratch. And possibly scratch the bike.

#### What if I don't want an ugly URL on my super-cool bicycle?

No problem. You don't need us. Go use any or all of the other bicycle registration services
out there.

Also, you could use bikexyz.com just to create a page for your bicycle. We're not going to
come check your bike to make sure the URL is on there.

There are probably some ways for you to get the URL onto your bike without creating too much ugly.


#### How do I know that bikexyz.com is going to be around forever?

Alas, we live in a world of impermanence. I really do plan to keep this thing alive.
Hopefully I've got a few years to figure out how to pass it on before I shuffle off this
mortal coil. At this point I'm just trying to get it off the ground.

So far the focus is to keep things simple. Limits on the number of photos uploaded is critical to making sure costs don't get out of hand. Keeping things simple (bare bones, even) will help keep down costs and make it more likely that this thing will survive.

If you have any great ideas on how to make this thing last, I wanna hear them.


#### Where is the best place to put the URL?

There are basically 3 tubes to work with, and 3 options for each. We'll assume that the chain stays and the seat stays (the two pairs of tubes that hold the rear wheel) are too narrow/small for writing on. The 3 main tubes are:

1. top tube (the one on top, horizontal)
2. down tube (goes from the front of the bike down to the cranks)
3. seat tube (where the seatpost goes)

For each of these, there are basically 3 options:

1. top/front
2. underneath/back
3. side

The worst places, unless you never want anybody to see the URL, would be underneath the down tube, or on the back of the seat tube. Both these places get dirty, and are more likely
to have the URL worn off/obscured.

On the front of the seat tube or underneath the top tube can work. The problem is that a
person almost has to go looking for the URL to find it there. More so underneath the top tube
than on the front of the seat tube. If you're worried about messing up your beautiful ride,
then underneath the top tube might be the best place. Nobody will see it there until they
want to do some maintenance.

A good place is on the side of any of the three main tubes. It will be obvious to anybody looking at the bike that there is something there. (Unless you write it too small.) It's not as likely to be messed up by dirt/grime or worn off.

The best place is is probably on top of the top tube, and second to that, on top of the down tube. Both these places are easily visible to a rider of the bicycle. Imagine your bike is stolen and then purchased by some Millicent Bystander. Having the URL in plain view, Millicent will eventually be compelled to check the address on-line, where she'll find that the bicycle is an ill-gotten gain, and then promptly return it.

Remember that the more obvious you make the URL on your bike, the more likely it is to be
returned, if stolen, **and** that the more obvious the URL is, the less likely your bike will
be stolen in the first place.

#### What's the best way to permanently write the URL on the bike?

Dunno.

This may be the weakest link in this entire endeavor. How does one write a URL on a bicycle so that it is:

* permanent
* legible
* unobscurable
* not ugly
* easy
* non-toxic
* non-removable

At this point, the easiest, most practical solution I can think of is to write on the
bicycle with a black or silver sharpie pen (depending on the color of the bike), and then
spraying it with some clear coat from the local hardware store. (Don't forget to clean off/wash & dry the area you're writing on first.)

In any case, I would highly recommend *practicing* first. Try writing it on something else, to make sure you've got the correct lettering size, that it will fit where you plan to put it, and that you know how to use the tools & materials you're working with.

I would love, love, love for you to let me know how you write the URL on your bike, and how well it works out.

#### Can I have a quick check list, please?

Here we go:

1. Registered and got URL from bikexyz.com?
3. Practiced with the tools/materials I'm using?
2. Practiced writing the URL?
3. What I wrote is clear and legible and will fit on the bike?
4. Know where I'm going to put the URL?
5. The surface is clean and dry?


#### Once I register with bikexyz.com, I don't need to register anywhere else, right?

Er, not quite right. There are places that require registration. For instance in Hawaii, bicycle registration is mandatory. Many states and localities have different requirements. Even colleges may mandate registration.

Truthfully, to maximize your chances of getting your bike back if it's stolen, you should register your bicycle in as many places as possible. That will make it more likely that it will make it's way back to you.

I believe that the approach taken here is the simplest, most straightforward, and most 
likely to recover your bike, but there's no guarantee. No registration service can guarantee recovery.
