## Frequently Asked Questions

(Nobody has actually asked any of these, but we won't let that stop us!)

#### How do I mark my bike with the registration address?

[We have a page for that!](/marking)


#### What is a "URL"?

A [URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator) is a web address.
It is a globally unique name of a page on the world wide web.
Everybody uses them all the time, even when they don't know what
they're called, or how they work. That's actually a good thing.

The real advantage for us is that just about everybody recognizes URLs
and knows how to use them.  If you see

    www.googlygop.com/blahblah
    
Nobody has to explain to you what to do with it. You put it in your computer or phone and see
what comes up.

#### Can't I just create my own page on the internet for my bike?

Yup.

You don't really need bikexyz.com to do any of this. You could just write a blog entry (for example), and put that URL on your bike. Here's a check list:

* A URL (a unique page) for your bike
* You are the only one able to edit it
* You **can** edit it
* The web address fits on your bike, legibly

What's wrong with this approach? If/when you want to sell your bike, you really need to be
able to let the new owner have control of the page. Otherwise they'll have to remove the
stuff you put on the bike, and start over from scratch. And possibly scratch the bike.

#### What if I don't want an ugly URL on my super-cool bicycle?

No problem. You don't need us. Go use any or all of the other bicycle registration services
out there.

Also, you could use bikexyz.com just to create a page for your bicycle. We're not going to
come check your bike to make sure the URL is on there.

There are probably some ways for you to get the URL onto your bike without creating too much ugly.

#### Once I register with bikexyz.com, I don't need to register anywhere else, right?

Er, not quite right. There are places that require registration. For instance in Hawaii, bicycle registration is mandatory. Many states and localities have different requirements. Even colleges may mandate registration.

Truthfully, to maximize your chances of getting your bike back if it's stolen, you should register your bicycle in as many places as possible. That will make it more likely that it will make it's way back to you.

I believe that the approach taken here is the simplest, most straightforward, and most 
likely to recover your bike, but there's no guarantee. No registration service can guarantee recovery.
