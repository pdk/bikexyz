<h2>How to Mark</h2>

Here is our current list of known methods.

1. Custom stickers [bikenames.com](http://www.bikenames.com)
2. Simple sticker (coming soon!)
3. Simple sticker plus spray adhesive
3. "Permanent" marker
4. "Permanent" marker plus spray clearcoat
4. Paint/stencil
5. Nail polish
6. Nail polish plus spray clearcoat

It's recommended that you use at least 2 methods to mark. The point being to make it difficult
for a thief to remove/obscure *all* the markings. Remember that even if you manage to mark your
bike in such a way that it is *impossible* to remove, it may still be trivial to cover up the 
mark (wrap the tube in duct tape).

Permanent markers are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpie_(marker)#Removal_and_safety" target="_blank">not really permanent</a>.
(Nothing in this world is really permanent.) Clearly, after your sharpie marks have time 
to set, it's going to be some work to remove it. But if you've sharpie'd your registration 
address in 4 places, and on your rim tape, it's gonna be a huge hassle for the thief to
remove them all. And he'll probably miss the rim tape.


<h2>Where to Mark</h2>

Minimally, you should put your registration address in 

1. at least one prominent place, and 
2. at least two obscure places. 

But that is minimal. More is better.

The most prominent places to mark your bike are on the sides of any of the main tubes (top, down,
seat), or on top of the top tube or down tube. On top of the top tube may be too annoying for you,
since it will (literally) be right in front of your face while you ride, but that will be exactly why
another "owner" of the bicycle will check the registration info. For "the best" prominent location, you're
best off just looking at your own bike to figure out where to put it. Every bicycle is different, and 
depending on your configuration (bottles, bags, cables, branding), you'll have your own "best" location.

Generally the seat stays and chain stays are narrower and less prominent, 
but the outside of the left chain stay can work as a prominent location. 
(The right chain stay is obscured by the chain.)

One important (obscure) location is underneath the down tube, near the bottom bracket. The bottom bracket is generally where
the serial number is stamped. It's good to put a mark there, since anybody who is actively investigating 
registration is going to look there for the serial number.

Other more and less obscure locations are underneath the top or down tube, or on the back of the seat tube. 
Also, inside the seat or chain stays can be good. You'll need to remove your rear wheel to get in there,
but that should not be a problem if you know how to fix a flat tire.

Basically, anywhere you can find a place to mark can work. It all depends on your tolerance for 
having writing (pretty or not) on your bike, and your desire to maintain ownership.

Here is a partial list:

* Prominent
  1. Side of a main tube (top, down, seat)
  2. Top of the top or the down tube
  3. Front/side of the head tube
  4. Outside of left chain stay
  5. Outside of the fork
* Obscure
  1. Underneath the down tube, next to the bottom bracket
  2. Underneath the top tube or the down tube
  3. Back of the seat tube
  4. Inside a chain stay or seat stay
  5. Inside of the fork
* Hidden
  1. Rim tape (on wheel, after removing tire and tube)
  2. Seat post, covered by seat tube
  3. Underneath the saddle
