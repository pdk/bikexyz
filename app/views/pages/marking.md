Here's a potential list of places to put the URL:

1. On the down tube, top tube or seat tube, so that it can be easily seen.
2. Underneath the top tube or down tube, to be seen when the bike is upside down.
3. On the rim tape inside your wheels, seen when repairing a flat.
4. On the seat post, inside the seat tube.
5. On the wheels, but not where the brakes will rub it off.
6. Inside your chain stays or seat stays.
