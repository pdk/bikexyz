## Why doesn't bicycle registration reduce bicycle theft?

### Short answer

Because it's too hard to check the registration.

### The long answer

There are exactly two reasons to register a bicycle:

1. Recovery
2. Theft deterrence

The basic idea of bicycle registration is that the owner of a bicycle can be identified. If a person is purchasing a bicycle, they should be able to confirm that the person selling the bicycle is the owner. If a bicycle is found somewhere, it should be possible to contact the owner so they can come get it.

Recovery does happen. But it happens much too rarely. Recovery usually happens when the police haul in a cache of obviously stolen bicycles, and then check the registration. It's very uncommon that a potential bicycle purchaser checks (or even can check) the registration of a bicycle before making a transaction.

Some registration services provide a sticker with instructions on how to check, or provide a sticker with a QR code that can be scanned. QR codes are technically cute, but practically nobody uses them, or knows how to in a hurry.

Even if it's not a QR code and there are clear instructions, it's still too much work. We need a solution that does not require instructions.

And if you're relying on a single sticker, it can be removed. Even if it's "tamper resistant", it's still too easy to make it illegible, or simply cover it up with some other sticker.

So, we're mostly down to the police checking serial numbers (hard to find and read) when they happen to end up with the bike (not likely). And you have to hope that the police actually check the registry where you registered.

In order for registration to provide a deterrence to theft, we need three things:

1. It's obvious to the thief that it's registered.
2. It's trivially easy for a potential buyer to check the registration.
3. It's too much work for the thief to remove the registration information.

Most registration services deal okay with #1. There is usually a sticker proclaiming the bike registered. But, like we already said, if it's just one sticker, then it fails on #3. And generally speaking, all fail on #2. If the registration system does not do all three, it will fail too often.


### Solution

How can we fix this? Here is the solution:

1. Assign a unique URL to each bike that can be checked by anybody with internet access.
2. Put the URL on the bicycle in multiple place, in multiple ways, both obvious and obscure.

By using a simple URL, we make it easy and quick for anybody to check the registration. Just about everybody knows what a URL looks like, and knows what to do with it. No instructions are necessary.

<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://bikexyz.com/MXFX/" target="_blank">bikexyz.com/MXFX/</a></li>
</ul>

There are no complicated instructions. There are no steps. Just do what everybody does with a URL, and you'll get the needed information.

By putting the URL in [multiple places](marking), it makes it harder for the thief to remove. By having the URL in hidden places, even if the thief manages to remove or obliterate the obvious ones, later, after the sale, the new "owner" will find the URL in an obscure place and check it.

Ok, now that you're convinced this is the best idea since squashed muffins, you can ...
