## bikexyz

This is a bicycle registration system, running at http://www.bikexyz.com.

The fundamental premise of this registry is that every bicycle deserves 
its own URL. That URL then can be marked upon the bike in many, various
places. The purpose being to make it trivial for anybody with a web 
browser to check the registration status of the bicycle. Also, having
the freedom to mark the bicycle how ever and where ever (rather than
with a single "tamper resistant" sticker) makes it more likely
that the registration mark will survive obfuscation by bike thieves.
